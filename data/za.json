      "summary": "A teacher by profession, Mr Mahlangu lists among his educational qualifications a BA Degree, from University of Fairfax. \r\nHis public and political life started in the late 1960s when he was elected President of the Student Christian Movement, in the then Eastern Transvaal. From 1973 to 1976 he was Assistant Secretary of the Transvaal United African Teachers Association. \r\nBecause of his active participation in politics in the 1970s and 1980s, he is one of the leaders who played a critical role in the processes leading to the first democratic South Africa in the early 1990s. Between 1991 and 1994, he was a negotiator at the Congress for Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and the Multiparty Negotiation Forum. In 1993, he became the Co-Chairperson of these bodies. From 1993 to 1994 he was a member of the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) which governed South Africa before the first general elections of April 1994. \r\nAfter the 1994 elections, he joined the National Assembly in Parliament for the ANC. As a member of the first democratic Parliament, he became a member of the Constitutional Assembly (CA), the body tasked with the drafting of the SA Constitution. As a member of the CA, he chaired the Core Group of the Theme Committee and the Theme Committee on Structures of Government. During his tenure as a Member of the National Assembly, he also served as Chairperson of Committees. \r\nIn 2002 he was elected permanent Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). After the third democratic elections in 2004, he was re-elected permanent Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP.

As a student, Mr Mashatile was an activist in the struggle against apartheid as a member of the Congress of South African Students, and was the co-founder and first president of the Alexandra Youth Congress. He was detained without trial from 1985-1989, and participated in a nation-wide protest by engaging in an 18-day hunger strike. When the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party were unbanned in 1990, he helped re-establish them and continued to organize on their behalf. He has held various administrative positions in Gauteng province, including serving in its legislature as Leader of the House.
