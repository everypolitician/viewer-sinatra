        <h1>What is EveryPolitician?</h1>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The clue’s in the name. EveryPolitician aims to provide data
          about, well, every politician. In the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a simple but ambitious project to collect and share that
          data, in a consistent, open format that anyone can use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? Because this resource doesn’t yet exist. And it would be
          incredibly useful, for a huge number of people and organisations
          all around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          When data is in a consistent, structured format, it can be reused
          by developers everywhere. You don’t have waste time scraping data
          and converting it into a format you can work with; instead, you
          can simply concentrate on making tools. And those tools can more
          easily be picked up, used and adapted to local needs anywhere in
          the world, saving everyone time and effort. 
        </p>

        <h2>The data</h2>
        <p>
          The long term aim is to include every elected official in the
          world, but let’s start simple. Our first goal is to have data for
          all present-day national-level legislators.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see how far we’ve got, <a href="/countries.html">pick a country</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s more to this data than you’ll see there, though. For most
          datasets there is richer information available, including contact
          details, photos, gender, and more. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to use that data, you can download it in two useful formats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <abbr title="comma separated value">CSV</abbr> format (great for spreadsheets)
          </li>
          <li>
            <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> in Popolo format (ideal for
              developers)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="process-boxes">
          <div class="step-1">
            <p>

        <p>
          A note about the Popolo standard: it’s a rich, expressive format that,
          like a language, is used in many different ways by different authors.
          However, when we add data to EveryPolitician we always use Popolo
          according to the same, defined principles. It’s because of this
          consistency that the tools you build will work with EveryPolitician data
          from any country, for any country.
        </p>
        <p>

          application or tool you’re building? See the <a

        <p>In a way, that’s up to you. The data’s here, now go and build the tools to use it! (And don’t forget to let us know when you do.)</p>
    
        <p>We already know that EveryPolitician’s data will help with existing projects, like these ones which make it easy to 
        <a href="http://sayit.poplus.org/">track what those politicians say</a>, or
        <a href="http://www.cargografias.org/">visualise their political careers</a>, or
        which enable citizens to <a href="http://writeit.poplus.org/">send public messages to them</a>. </p>

        <p>As data becomes available from more countries, all in the same format,
        more and more tools like this will become possible.</p>
