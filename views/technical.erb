          <a href="/">EveryPolitician</a> makes data about politicians
          available in a consistent manner. If you’re a developer who wants
          to write code that consumes that data, this page is for you.
        </p>
        <h2>The data: CSV or JSON (Popolo)</h2>
        <p>
          EveryPolitician publishes the data so you can use it however you want.
          Use it to power your tools, to drive data-based projects, and to help
          people know more about who their politicians are. It’s available to
          download in either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Broadly speaking, we provide the complete, rich data in JSON. We use the <a
          href="http://www.popoloproject.com/">Popolo standard</a> &mdash; if
          you’re a developer that’s great for you because you get every
          detail of the data. The CSV data is simpler &mdash; it’s ideal for
          dropping into a spreadsheet or displaying in a web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if someone's name changes during a period (eg. if
          they get married), the later version will be presented as their
          name in the CSV. But if you dive into the JSON data you’re be able
          to see the dates when this new name applied, and what it was
          before. You can think of the JSON as the full data in its raw
          form, and the CSVs as the refined, more pragmatic version.
        </p>
        <p>
          EveryPolitician doesn’t provide an API for you to query the data
          &mdash; we simply make the whole lot available for download, and if you
          need to be selective about which bits to use, you can do that
          processing at your end. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we <em>do</em> slice the CSV data up into separate files
          for each legislative period for a country.  We use these
          "parliamentary terms" because pretty much every legislature in the
          world can be broken down in this way, and applications often only
          really want to know data about the people currently in these
          positions. For many countries we currently only <em>have</em> data
          for the current period, but we‘re very keen to also add older,
          "historic" data too.
