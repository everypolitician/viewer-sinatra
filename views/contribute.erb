        <p class="section-intro">
          EveryPolitician is an ambitious project. If we’re to succeed in our
          aim of collecting and sharing data on every elected official in the
          entire world, we need help from people like you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, we’re concentrating on making sure we have current data on
          the national legislatures for every country in the world.
        </p>
        <h2>If your country is missing</h2>
        <a name="process"></a>
        <p>
          Here are the three steps we follow to put a country on the
          <a href="countries.html">EveryPolitician map</a>:
        </p>
        <div class="process-boxes">
          <div class="step-0">
            1. find the data somewhere on the web
            <p>
              That might simply be finding a list of politicians on the
              parliament’s website, or knowing of a local group that already
              collects this data.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-1">
            2. turn that into a format we can import
            <p>
              Often that means running a scraper that gets the data off the
              webpage and turns it into the kind of data we can easily import
              (or, if we’re lucky, doing next to nothing because it’s already
              in a lovely format).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-2">
            3. pull it into EveryPolitician
            <p>
              We add it to the project by telling EveryPolitician where the
              importable data is, and how to merge it in.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Have a look at the list of
          <a href="needed.html">countries we don’t
          have data for yet</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a country is listed under &ldquo;<strong>Source
          needed</strong>&rdquo; then it’s still at step 1 of the process. If
          you know where there is comprehensive poltician data for that
          country, please let us know!
        </p>
        <p>
          Incidentally, there may be more than one source for a given country’s
          data. Ideally, everything is in one place. However, things are often
          more complicated than that, so one site might have all the
          politician’s names and party memberships, but a different site has
          their twitter handles. But that’s OK because we’re happy to merge
          different sources.
        <p>
        <p>
          If a country appears under &ldquo;<strong>Scraper
          needed</strong>&rdquo; it means that we do have at least one source
          for the data, but so far nobody has turned that data into <a
          href="submitting.html">a format we can easily import</a> &mdash; this
          is waiting at step 2. It will be on our list of things to do (in
          fact, you should see it as an
          <a href="https://github.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22To+Find%22++label%3A%22New+country%22+">issue
          on GitHub</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          If we’re very lucky the data identified in the source is already in a
          lovely format, and we can move straight to step 3. That’s very rare,
          though, so normally the data will need to be taken off the web pages
          it’s on and turned into easy-to-import data. That’s what the scrapers
          do, and we basically have one for every country whose data is in
          EveryPolitician.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re a developer and you fancy writing such a scraper, we’d be
          stupendously grateful. We’ve written some <a
          href="scrapers.html">guidelines about writing scrapers</a> to help
          you (depending on how complex or clean the source data, it might be
          easier &mdash; and more fun! &mdash; than you think).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the data’s in a suitable format, we’ll add it to
          EveryPolitician’s list of scrapers (what this really means is making
          the Rake tasks aware of where to get the formatted data, and how to
          merge it all together). That’s step 3 and we’ll take care of that for
          you.
        </p>

          In summary, if you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            know where there’s a missing source for a country we’re currently lacking
          </li>
          <li>
            have some or all of the data we’re looking for, or can put us in
            touch with a group who has it, or even just know where we can find
            it in a reasonably well-structured form
          </li>
          <li>
            or want to write a scraper for one of the countries we haven’t done yet
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ...then please send an email to
          <a
          href="mailto:team@everypolitician.org">team@everypolitician.org</a>
          and tell us!
        </p>

        <h2>If you see an error in the data</h2>

        <p>Found something incorrect in the data we’re currently displaying on the site?</p>

        <p>We’re working on building tools to let you edit the data directly, 
        but in the meantime, if you see an error that should be corrected, 
        email us at <a href="mailto:team@everypolitician.org">team@everypolitician.org</a>.</p>

        <p>Please include evidence for your proposed change — a link to an
        official source, where possible.</p>

        <h2>If there are gaps in the data</h2>

        <p>At this early stage, we’re focusing on making sure we have basic
        information about the current legislators in every country: names,
        contact details, political parties, and the areas they represent. 
        Please help us gather that if you can.</p>

        <p>Covering every current legislature is our primary goal right now,
        but it’s always great when we can obtain past information too. See,
        for example, <a href="/greenland/">the data for Greenland</a>, which
        contains data on every Member since the formation of its current
        Parliament in 1979.</p>

        <h2>Looking for different data?</h2>

        <p>In this initial phase, we’re only collecting information about <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_country">country-level
        Parliaments and Congresses</a>. Eventually we hope that much more than
        this will be available, but having every national legislature would be a
        great first step.</p>
