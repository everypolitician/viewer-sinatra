        <h1>About EveryPolitician’s Data</h1>

        <p class="lead">EveryPolitician’s data is not complete. It doesn’t yet cover every
        nation in the world. We’re working on that (and 
        <a href="/contribute.html">you can help too!</a>). </p>

        <p>In creating EveryPolitician, we’ve made some decisions about what it
        will — and what it won’t — try to provide. This page explains how and why
        we made those decisions.</p>

        <h2>Consistent and useful</h2>

        <p>EveryPolitician’s goal is to provide basic data on every politician in
        every national-level legislature in the world, in a <em>consistent and
        useful</em> format.</p>

        <p>The word "consistent" is important, and we use it in a very specific way:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We aim to use appropriate standards where possible (particularly 
            <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/">Popolo</a>)</li>
          <li>We try to follow clear conventions about how data within and beyond 
            those standards are expressed</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>With this in mind, EveryPolitician will only provide data that we’re
        confident can be expressed in the same manner across the majority of
        national legislatures. This means there’s useful and interesting data
        we’re deliberately choosing to not include yet, and some that we
        probably never will.</p>

        <p>Because we’re being very careful about what data we’re including, and
        exactly what format it will be presented in, you can be very clear what
        data you can — and cannot — expect to find here, and if you use it, you
        won’t need to spend so much time dealing with lots of exceptional
        cases.</p>

        <p>(NB: Because some of this data was supplied by other people, we can’t
        yet completely guarantee that the format for every country is completely
        identical yet. But we’re actively working on fixing that, so if you find
        something unexpected, please let us know!)</p>

        <h2>Why we’re doing this</h2>

        <p>We want to make it much easier for people to get started when building
        civic tech tools.</p>

        <p>Rather than having to start by finding data and turning that into a
        usable format — a process that can be deceptively tricky, especially if
        your tool needs to work across multiple countries — we can provide the
        initial data so you can concentrate on adding value on top of that.</p>

        <p>Rather than having to start by finding data and turning that into a
        usable format — a process that can be deceptively tricky, especially if
        your tool needs to work across multiple countries — we can provide the
        starting data so you can concentrate on adding value on top of that.</p>

        <p>In many cases the data EveryPolitician provides won’t be enough for
        what you need — you’ll need to combine it with other information
        locally. </p>

        <p>But you should be able to get started much more quickly, and by using
        data in the same consistent format that lots of other groups use
        worldwide, any tools you build for one country are likely to work much
        more easily in other countries too.</p>

        <p>This is part of the <a href="http://poplus.org">Poplus federation</a>’s
        mission of building and sharing re-usable civic tech. In fact, this project
        has come about based on our experience of working with code and data reuse
        <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/about/mysociety-around-the-world/">across
        many countries worldwide</a>.</p>

        <h2>What data we provide</h2>

        <p>Put most simply, EveryPolitician data is primarily a list of data
        about <em>people</em>. Those people must be members of a specific legislature
        (for example, your country’s current parliament).</p>

        <p>Those people may be members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group">factions or parties</a>, 
        and represent particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district">districts or constituencies</a>, 
        so we provide some information about those too.</p>

        <p>There are two distinct types of information provided:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><p><strong>Entity data</strong></p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Relationship data</strong></p></li> 
        </ol>

        <h3>Entity data</h3>

        <p>When we provide details about a Poltician, Political Group/Party,
        Constituency/District, or Legislative Period/Term, we adhere to the
        equivalent <a href="http://popoloproject.com/">Popolo Project specification</a>
        (as a <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/specs/person.html">Person</a>,
        <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/specs/organization.html">Organization</a>,
        <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/specs/area.html">Area</a>, and
        <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/specs/event.html">Event</a>)</p>

        <p>Popolo defines these entities very well, although we make a few
        extensions to include fields that are not yet standardised, and we
        plan to tighten things up where there are multiple ways to include the
        same information.</p>

        <h3>Relationship data</h3>

        <p>Not every politician is in EveryPolitician (yet). We’re currently
        limiting it to members of national-level legislatures
        (Parliament/Congress/Assembly).</p>

        <p>So, for now, the only Relationship information we provide is the
        Membership of that Legislature. Popolo has not (yet?) standardised how
        to model things like this, and unfortunately we’ve seen many different,
        and largely mutually-exclusive, approaches to that, making it very
        difficult to write tools that can operate on this sort of
        information.</p>

        <p>So we consistently express all such memberships as a Popolo
        <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/specs/membership.html">Membership</a> with the
        following fields:</p>

        <ul>
          <li> <p><code>person</code>: the politician (Person)</p> </li>
          <li> <p><code>organization</code>: the Legislature itself (Organization)</p> </li>
          <li> <p><code>on_behalf_of</code>: the Parliamentary Group (faction, party) they are a member of (Organization)</p> </li>
          <li> <p><code>area</code>: the district or constituency, where appropriate (Area)</p> </li>
          <li> <p><code>legislative_period</code>: the Term of office (Event)</p> </li>
          <li> <p><code>start_date</code> and/or <code>end_date</code> (if these differ from the start or end of the Term)</p> </li>
        </ul>

        <p>(People familiar with Popolo might wonder why we don’t use
        <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/specs/post.html">Posts</a> here. 
        Posts <em>can</em> be useful in some contexts, but in our experience
        we’ve found that they only really work well in places with single-member
        constituencies, and we believe that the simplicity of having every
        legislature expressed in exactly the same way is much more valuable than
        the benefits of sometimes using Posts.)</p>

        <h3>What we don’t provide (and why)</h3>

        <p>There is lots of other very valuable data available on politicians
        worldwide, and eventually we hope to include much more.</p>

        <p>But for now we don’t include anything other than the above — no asset
        declarations, no memberships of corporate boards, or parliamentary
        committees, or ministerial positions, etc.</p>

        <p>Of course we’re not saying that this data isn’t important — far from
        it! — just that we haven’t yet worked out how to provide it in
        a way that is consistent and comparable across all national
        jurisdictions.</p>

        <p>As standards or conventions appear around these things, we’ll start
        to include them, but for now we believe it’s much more important to
        start with data that can be consistent everywhere.</p>

        <h4>Wait! EveryPolitician doesn’t tell me who’s President/Prime Minister/Premier?</h4>

        <p>That’s right – because that’s a role in the <em>executive</em> branch of
        government, not the <em>legislative</em> branch — and for now we’re only
        providing legislative information.</p>

        <p>In some countries, the head of the government <em>is</em> also member
        of the legislature, and if so they’ll appear in the data — but simply in
        the same manner as any other member.</p>

        <h4>Why don’t you just add a field for “is_leader”, or add an Organisation for the Cabinet?</h4>

        <p>Yes: we’ve seen people do both of these things — and other things too. And
        this is an excellent example of why it’s important that data doesn’t solely adhere
        to a <strong>standard</strong>, but also that it’s <strong>consistent</strong>. 

        <p>We’ve seen about six or seven different ways that some of these
        things can be expressed, all in perfectly valid Popolo.</p>

        <p>Within the context of a single country, each of them makes perfect sense. But
        because they’re all different, any third-party tool needs to understand
        how <em>all</em> of them are modelled if it wants to be able to do
        something with data from multiple different sources.</p>

        <p>So we aren’t going to add fields like this until someone works out
        the best way to do it — in a manner that can work the same way pretty
        much everywhere, and can cope with all the complexity and idiosyncrasies
        of all the different ways countries worldwide organise their
        governance.</p>

        <p>If you know how to do that, great! Start a discussion about it on the <a
        href="https://github.com/popolo-project/popolo-spec/issues/new">Popolo
        tracker</a>, and once there’s consensus we’ll look at adding it.</p>

        <h4>But doesn’t that make this data incomplete?</h4>

        <p>Yes it is incomplete, but it’s <em>consistent and useful</em>. 

        <p>We’re providing a <em>base data set</em> that you can build on. Just
        because <em>our</em> data doesn’t include a field for who the President
        is, that doesn’t mean that your application can’t store that
        separately.</p>

        <h4>But I already have complete, rich data for my country’s representatives.</h4>

        <p>You probably don’t need EveryPolitician’s data then. But you could
        help others.<p>

        <p>Let us know (at team@everypolitician.org) what data you have, and
        we’ll work with you to transform it into the EveryPolitician Popolo
        format so that everyone else can benefit from it too.</p>
